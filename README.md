# Python-Projects
### Here, I have decided to track my progress in the Python language by implementing my knowledge in creating a few projects. Hope you like it.
- Project 1 : Calculator in Python to perform basic arithmetic operations.
- Project 2 : Madlibs - Here you have to enter a bunch of adjectives, nouns, verbs, etc. without any context and they will be put into a paragraph with blanks in which they may or may not make sense. This will lead to the paragraph being funny and hopefully you will enjoy it.
- Project 3 : Guess the number (user) - The computer will generate a random number and the user has to guess the right number.
